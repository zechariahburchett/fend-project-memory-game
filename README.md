## Project Notes

This project is a clone of the project found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game). The source project had initial HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. This project is the result from the changing the static project to an interactive one. To do this the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files were modified.
